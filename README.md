Projects don’t just happen. There’s a lot of work before they’re approved, and once they have been given the go-ahead, there’s even more planning and scheduling needed! How do you communicate that information with stakeholders and the team so they understand the project?

 - UI/navigation 
- Performance 
- load, stress and scalability 
- Security - vulnerabilities, encryption 

- Compatibility 
- browsers, devices, OS 
- Usability - ease of use, accessibility 

Approach 
- Black box and white box testing techniques

Deliverables 

- Functional test cases and reports 
- Performance test scripts and results - Security vulnerabilities report 

- User acceptance testing report 
- Test coverage and defect reports
 - Automation regression suite 

Team & Schedule Testing
 
-	team of 5 members needed for 4 months testing effort Proposed schedule: 
- April: Functional and security testing 
- May: Load/performance testing 
- June: Compatibility testing, UAT - July: Regression testing 


Entry & Exit Criteria User stories
 
-	to be tested must meet the defined 'Ready for Testing' criteria. 
-	Testing completes when all test cases execute with no critical defects outstanding. 

Risks
